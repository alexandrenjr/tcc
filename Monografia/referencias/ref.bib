  ABSTRACT = {Herein, robust pole placement controller design for linear uncertain discrete time dynamic systems is addressed. The adopted approach uses the so called &ldquo;D regions&rdquo; where the closed loop system poles are determined to lie. The discrete time pole regions corresponding to the prescribed damping of the resulting closed loop system are studied. The key issue is to determine the appropriate convex approximation to the originally non-convex discrete-time system pole region, so that numerically efficient robust controller design algorithms based on Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) can be used. Several alternatives for relatively simple inner approximations and their corresponding LMI descriptions are presented. The developed LMI region for the prescribed damping can be arbitrarily combined with other LMI pole limitations (e.g., stability degree). Simple algorithms to calculate the matrices for LMI representation of the proposed convex pole regions are provided in a concise way. The results and their use in a robust controller design are illustrated on a case study of a laboratory magnetic levitation system.},

  abstract = {The problem of allocating the closed-loop poles of linear systems in specific regions of the complex plane defined by discrete time-domain requirements is addressed. The resulting non-convex set is inner-approximated by a convex region described with linear matrix inequalities. The proposed approach enables a trade-off between computational complexity in terms of mathematical program size and conservativeness. A case study is then carried out on a step-up power converter, comparing three different techniques. Experimental results are provided to show how the proposed control strategy can be employed to enhance its start-up and transient responses when subjected to input voltage and load variations.}
